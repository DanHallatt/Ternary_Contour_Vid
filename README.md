# Ternary_Contour_Vid
Makes a video of a stitched series of ternary contour plots while a window slides through a series of 3-dimensional data. Contours are based on 'spatial'-density of datapoints in the domain of the ternary plot.

<!-- Options -->
## Options
 User can specify the following parameters when calling the function:
 - colour of the colour gradient, according to cmap available options (https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).
 - the number of contours.
 - the end-members of the plot, which must match the content of the input dataset (systems are: [Si+Al, Mg, Fe], [Si+Al, Mg+Fe, O], or [S, Ni, Fe]).
 - the width of the window (in units of number of datapoints).
 - the starting datapoint which to generate the first video frame from.
 - the number of steps of the window (a subset of the entire dataset can be plotted, given this parameter, the width of the window and the starting datapoint specified by the user).
 - the frames per second.
 - to plot the position of the window, either in units of datapoint index or in associated distance of each datapoint from a datum (in the case that the series of data is from a line-scan for example).

 - WindDispPositionData =[Distance1, Distance2, ... Distance3] in nm.
 - ContLines = 'n'
 - NumLevels = 7
 - Colour = 'Blues'
 - type = 'silicate'
 - WindDispType = 'distance'
 - WindowWidth = 10
